I'm a research scientist collaborating with NASA and Argonne/Idaho national lab, doing research on bayesian optimization and decision for in-space manufacturing and materials science. I am a member of MRS and AAAI. I lead engineering and AI teams from undergrads to PhDs. Raised 1.6M from NASA & Department of Energy. Conceptualize, author and review journals, whitepapers, govt grant proposals, cited in 100s.
